# Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of sales data using Python and a suite of data science libraries. The main goal of this project is to extract actionable insights from raw sales data through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques. It is an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) pipeline that prepares the data for further statistical modeling or machine learning applications.

***

### Libraries Used
- pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
- NumPy – Numerical operations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
- SciPy & Statsmodels – Statistical analysis
- Scikit-learn – Data preprocessing (missing value imputation)

***

### Key Steps Performed
1) Data Cleaning: Identified and imputed missing values using median strategy
2) Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized distributions and correlations using Seaborn and Matplotlib
3) Statistical Transformations: Applied techniques like square root transformation to normalize data
4) Basic Trend Analysis: Performed basic statistical evaluation using scipy.stats and statsmodels

***

### How to run
You can run this notebook directly on Google Colab without the need to set up a local development environment. This allows you to explore and execute the analysis in the cloud, with all necessary dependencies pre-installed.
